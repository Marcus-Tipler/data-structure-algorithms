## Backlog

- [ ] Function creation for Array Creator that takes a list variable containing the amount of items per week.

- [ ] Create a quicksort algorithm to sort the weekly values that takes the variable for the unsorted weekly output from ArrayCreator
- [ ] Make a loop for the QuickSort Algorithm.
